# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the PyBer analysis:

V. Isualize has given Omar and me the task of creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Following that we will use Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Our data will show that the ride data of rural drivers are very different from the Suburban and Urban drivers could have decision-makers at PyBer provide incentives to get their rural riders and drivers to increase their usage.

### Results:

*Figure 1: PyBer_summary_df*<br />

* There was more than 10x the number of Total Rides in Urban cities than in Rural ones
* The Average Fare per Ride was about $10 more expensive in Rural cities than in Urban ones.
* The Total Fare in Urban cities was more than 9x the number of the Total Fares in Rural cities

* The plot shows the huge disparity between the total fares between the rural and urban cities

### Summary:

Our data shows that the ride data of rural drivers are drastically lower across the board. The main area that we would want to increase is our total rides ad drives, which in turn increases our total fares. The decision-makers at PyBer could provide incentives such as discounted rides for riders or "cashback" rewards for drivers based on the number of rides they give. The discounted rides will cause rural riders to want to increase their app usage. The "cashback" rewards, based on the number of rides the user gives will cause more drivers to be willing to work more rides, even if they are longer to earn rewards. Those rewards could be cashback, a bigger percentage of the ride fare or even a free tank of gas. This in turn will cause more riders and drivers to use the app in turn increasing our Total Fares for our Rural cities.
