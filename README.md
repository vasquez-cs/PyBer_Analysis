# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

V. Isualize has given Omar and I the task of creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Following that we will using Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Our data will show that the ride data of rural drivers are very different from the Suburban and Urban drivers that could have decision-makers at PyBer provide incentives to get their rural riders and drivers to increase their usage.

### Results:

### Summary:

Our data shows that the ride data of rural drivers are drastically lower across the board. The main area that we would want to increase is our total rides ad drives, which in turn increases our total fares. The decision-makers at PyBer could provide provide incentives such as discounted rides for riders or "cashback" rewards for drivers based on the number of rides they give. The discounted rides will cause rural riders to want to incease their app usage. The "cashback" rewards, based on number of rider gives will cause more drivers willing to work more rides, evern if they are longer to earn rewards. Those rewards could be cashback, a bigger percentage of the ride fare or even a free tank of gas. This in turn will cause more riders and drivers to use the app in turn increasing our Total Fares for our Rural cities.
